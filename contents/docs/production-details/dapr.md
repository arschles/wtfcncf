# Dapr

[Dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr) is a sidecar process that gives you standard interfaces to talk to other apps \(e.g. microservices\) and cloud services, no matter where your app is running, how it's running, and what language it's in.

> A "sidecar" process is a program that runs "next to" your main process. Sidecar processes usually do supplemental tasks like log aggregation or figuring out SSL certificates. They aren't "business logic" but they're really important for your app
