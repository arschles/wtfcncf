## What Cloud Native does

Cloud native is a new set of technologies, a culture, and a formal organization (the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io)) that introduces brand new way to run web apps in production.

Some people call it a revolution.

##  How you can use it for your app

You can use cloud native technologies to help you run more reliable apps. There are a bunch of different technologies that you can choose from, and here they are by category:

- You can use stuff to help you with networking between your app and other APIs (like your database)
- Stuff to help you put your app inside of a [container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) so that it's completely self-contained
- Stuff to help you run those containers reliably
- Stuff to help you run more reliable databases

... and more!

>Cloud native is all about abstracting away your individual VMs or machines, if you're not in the cloud. You'll deal mostly with [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) instead.
