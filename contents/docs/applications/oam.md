# OAM

[OAM](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec) stands for the **O**pen **A**pplication **M**ode. It's a specification that lets you define an entire application, including all its components.

It doesn't have to be in Kubernetes, but as with most of these technologies, the first and primary implementation of this spec is targeted at Kubernetes.
